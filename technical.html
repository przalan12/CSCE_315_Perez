                        Tabs is a product aimed to help airlines match with customers to help find their lost luggage at airports.
                        Losing items at airports is a especially common occurrence for travelers and is also extremely devastating
                        when they come to lose valuable items. With an intuitive interface for users to intract with, it makes easy to submit a lost item
                        and quickly be matched and contacted by airlines staff. The product was created with my team during TamuHack 2023.

                <p>Participated in undegraduate research for STIMI Lab at Texas A&M. I was in charge of preprocessing gigabytes of clinical data to train 
                    a machine learning model for medical purposes. Worked closely with python along with its associated data science libraries such as pandas, numpy, and matplotlib to manipulate and organize the data to showcase results.
