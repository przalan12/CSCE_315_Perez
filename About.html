            <h1 class = "aboutH1">A little about me!</h1>
            <p>I was born and raised in <a href="https://dallascityhall.com/Pages/default.aspx"> Dallas, Texas </a>for the early years of my life.
                I attended elementary school taking bilingual classes until the fourth grade.
                My childhood was filled with learning new things everyday and playing soccer with friends after school.
                Shortly afterwards, everything changed when my family and I decided to move from city life in Dallas to the
                countryside of <a href="https://www.ci.greenville.tx.us/">Greenville, TX</a>.
                This move was a major transition for me, as I had to adapt to a new school and environment.
                Although different, this shift taught me about the importance of independence and
                responsibility, as I learned to take care of the many new animals we had on our new property.
            </p> <br>
            <p>It was not until high school where my passion for programming and developing projects truly took root. During
                my freshman year, I had the opportunity to learn the fundamentals of web development, which sparked a deep
                interest in me. The skills I learned motivated me to continue to take more courses focused on programming,
                leading me to take <a href="https://apstudents.collegeboard.org/courses/ap-computer-science-a">AP Computer Science</a> my junior year. I participated in <a href="https://www.uiltexas.org/"> UIL </a> programming competitions where
                my enthusiasm for solving challenging and tough problems all started.
            </p> <br>
            <p>As of now, I am attending <a href="https://www.tamu.edu/"> Texas A&M University </a> where I am studying Computer Science. I am actively involved
                with various clubs on campus, such as the <a href="https://tamuacpc.com/home">Aggie Competitive Programming(ACPC)</a>. I have also participated in
                engineering and computer science-led research for the university, which has allowed me to gain valuable
                hands-on experience and expand my knowledge within both fields.
            </p> <br>
            <p>After graduation, I plan to pursue a career in the tech, specifically in software engineering
                or data science.
                Also, some fun facts about myself are that I have two dogs - one chihuahua named Chansey and one blue heeler
                named Rocco.
                Occasionally, I like to watch anime when I am not busy with anything.
